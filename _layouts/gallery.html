                <p>I would like to start my story with my experience working at <a href="https://en.ichei.org/dist/index.html#/" target="_blank">UNESCO-ICHEI</a>. I was lucky to have the opportunity to work there because the third World Higher Education Conference was held in Barcelona in May 2022. The Department of Knowledge Production and Communication Centers at UNESCO-ICHEI needed someone proficient in both new media and Spanish. Luckily, this opportunity came to me, and I was chosen. I guess that was the moment when my connection with Barcelona began to take shape.</p>
				<p>Also feel free to check out one of the publications I have contributed to:  
				<i><a href="https://en.ichei.org/dist/index.html#/reader?id=1282&qk_qishu=4&lang=1" target="_blank">World Higher Education Conference amid Digital Transformation of Higher Education</a></i>.

                <h3 class="card-title">Literal First Steps</h3>
                <p>I was born in 2000, but I started kindergarten when I was only one and a half years old. In 2006, I graduated from kindergarten and even wore a bachelor's gown for my graduation photos.</p>
				<p>In June 2022, I finally graduated from Guangdong University of Foreign Studies with a bachelor's degree in Hispanic Philology. By then, I had already decided to move to Barcelona to pursue my master's degree and begin a new chapter in my life. However, I didn’t yet know that just a few years later, I would become a PhD student.</p>

                <p> I completed my master's degree in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra from September 2022 to July 2023, under the supervision of Dr. Janet DeCesaris.</p>
                <p>I am deeply grateful to have been her final student during her last year of teaching. I cherish every meeting in Janet's office, where we spoke as both mentor and mentee, as well as friends. 
				Janet was my most important guide—patiently answering all my questions and offering unwavering support, encouragement, and guidance, both academically and personally. Without her, I could not have made such progress in my field.</p>
				<p>In July 2023, I successfully defended my master's thesis with distinction.</p>
